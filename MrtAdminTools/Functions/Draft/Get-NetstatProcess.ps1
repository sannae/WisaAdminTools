# Analisi solo su connessioni TCP
# netstat non si allontana molto dai risultati di Get-NetTcpConnection,
# basti eseguire (netstat -qno -p TCP).Count versus (Get-NetTcpConnection).Count e si vede che la differenza Ã¨ minima.

<#
	Closed	 	- The TCP connection is closed. 
	CloseWait 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for a connection termination request from the local user. 
	Closing 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for an acknowledgement of the connection termination request sent previously. 
	DeleteTcb 	- The transmission control buffer (TCB) for the TCP connection is being deleted. 
	Established 	- The TCP handshake is complete. The connection has been established and data can be sent. 
	FinWait1 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for a connection termination request from the remote endpoint or for an acknowledgement of the connection termination request sent previously. 
	FinWait2 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for a connection termination request from the remote endpoint. 
	LastAck 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for the final acknowledgement of the connection termination request sent previously. 
	Listen	 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is listening for a connection request from any remote endpoint. 
	SynReceived 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection has sent and received a connection request and is waiting for an acknowledgment. 
	SynSent 	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection has sent the remote endpoint a segment header with the synchronize (SYN) control bit set and is waiting for a matching connection request. 
	TimeWait	- The local endpoint of the TCP connection is waiting for enough time to pass to ensure that the remote endpoint received the acknowledgement of its connection termination request. 
	Unknown		- The TCP connection state is unknown.
	
	Values are based on the TcpState Enumeration:

# :hammer: MrtAdminTools :wrench:
A PowerShell module with some useful CLI tools (hopefully!) meant for administrators and operators of the MRT Application Suite

Main components:
* The module root folder is `\MrtAdminTools`
* Dependencies are handled by `PSDepend`
* Build tasks are handled by `InvokeBuild`
* Unit tests are handled by `Pester`
* The whole test-build-release pipeline is summarized in `azure-pipelines.yaml`
